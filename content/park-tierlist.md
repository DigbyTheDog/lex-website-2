# Explanation and Methodology

I thought it would be fun if Alanis and I documented our thoughts on every public park in San Francisco and ranked them. For those which we have already visited, we must visit them again, pay close attention to how much we like them, and discuss. We'll take a selfie and each one as thumbnails for the tier list. Each of us will grade the park on a scale of 0-100 and use the average to determine the letter grade. S-rank will be reserved for when we both agree the park deserves it. We are updating this as we go rather than completing it all at once. Below you can find a summary of our thoughts on each included park. 

## A-Tier

### Land's End

At Land's End, you have beautiful scenery and long coastal trails. This is less of an urban park and more of a large nature preserve. Land's End offers breathtaking views of the Golden Gate and the Pacific Ocean, and is famously home to the ruins of the Sutro Baths. We found that this one was difficult to rank, due to being different from other included parks. It's an S-rank trail to be certain, but it's not great as a park in the traditional sense. With that said, it's not really trying to be an urban park, so we will put it in the A tier for now.
