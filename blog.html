          <h3>Our Trip to Singapore</h3>
          <h4 style="margin-top: 0px;">2025-02-10</h4>
        </div>
        <p>Alanis and I recently took a two week trip to Singapore. We stayed in Singapore for two nights, and then we went on a cruise for five nights, and then we stayed another two nights in Singapore.</br></br>The 17-hour flight was longer than we'd ever experienced, but personally I enjoyed it, as I like being lazy and watching movies and reading.</p></br><img width="500px" src="images/Singapore/1.jpeg" /></br><p>Our first full day in Singapore, we were taken off guard because it was Chinese New Year, which we had forgotten about, and it's a huge deal in Singapore. There were a lot of crowds, and celebrations, and it was pretty overwhelming. We enjoyed the following day more as we'd learned what to expect by then.</br></br>The cruise was fantastic, we had stops in Georgetown, Penang, Malaysia and Phuket, Thailand. In Malaysia, we took a tour of some of the historic spots of the area, including a Peranakan museum, and a clan jetty. In Thailand, we did snorkeling and rode canoes through caves. The Thailand stop was more of a beach/resort place, whereas the stop in Malaysia felt like more culture. Both were very good.</br></p><img width="500px" src="images/Singapore/2.jpeg" /><p></br>On the cruise, we were really impressed with the food and the entertainment. Unfortunately, Alanis caught some sort of cold or flu around the fourth night, and I got food poisoning the same day, so we did not get to fully enjoy the day of cruising only with no stops.</br></br>When we were back from the cruise and had a couple more days in Singapore, we were basically professional Singaporers at that point, and made the most of our time. Singapore has a lot of cool nonsense. Some highlights that come to mind were the zoo, the Gardens by the Bay, and their giant goofy ferris wheel.</br></p><img width="500px" src="images/Singapore/3.jpeg" /><p></br>Alanis thoughts: "I had a lot of fun... And it was very nice... I like Thailand best... I think... I would like to go on a dedicated trip to Thailand... My favorite part was how cheeeaaap it was... That's very nice. And I think cheap countries are more fun than expensive countries personally... 'Cuz then you can buy whatever you WANT!!!"</p>

        <p>Some of these blog posts will have images, I suppose. Here's what one of these posts would look like with an image included. In this case, I chose pacman, because I think he's cute. Look at him</p>
